  "product_overview": "LEVANTE Dashboard is an application catering to two user roles: Participants (students, parents/caregivers, teachers) who complete tasks, assessments, and surveys, and Administrators who manage organizations, assignments, and users. The platform offers a secure sign-in process and role-specific post-login experiences to enhance user productivity.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide secure and versatile authentication options including email/password and Google SSO for users.",
    "Deliver a seamless user experience where users are directed to role-appropriate landing pages after login.",
    "Enable participants to select assignments and complete associated tasks with optional assessments and surveys.",
    "Equip administrators with tools for managing organizations, user roles, and assignments.",
    "Support multilingual survey experiences with audio and locale-specific content."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Authentication & sign-in flows using Firebase Auth with multiple sign-in methods (email/password, Google SSO, email link).",
    "Participant dashboard with assignment selection, task rendering, and survey experiences using SurveyJS with locale and audio support.",
    "Admin UI to manage organizations, create assignments, and manage users and roles.",
    "Translation and i18n pipeline supporting CSV-based Crowdin integration for modular JSON locales.",
    "Post-login navigation adapting to user roles with secure route guarding."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User navigates to /signin endpoint and selects preferred authentication method (email/password, Google SSO, or email link).",
    "Upon successful authentication, participants are redirected to their home page where they can select assignments and access tasks and surveys.",
    "Upon successful authentication, administrators are redirected to an admin landing page with user and organization management features.",
    "In the participant flow, surveys load locale-specific audio and text, with progress saved and restored during sessions.",
    "Admins can create assignments, list groups and users, and assign roles through a dedicated interface."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Sign-in form accepts and validates credentials appropriately for all supported methods.",
    "After login, the app route changes away from /signin and the landing UI loads correctly for both participant and admin roles.",
    "Participant dashboards load assignments and tasks accurately, with surveys properly localized and audio played based on locale.",
    "Admin interfaces correctly display organization and user data and allow management functions.",
    "Translation files compile correctly from CSV inputs and render accurately in relevant components across locales."
