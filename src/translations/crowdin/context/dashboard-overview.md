# LEVANTE Dashboard Translation Context

## Project Overview

The LEVANTE Dashboard is a research platform designed for studying how children learn and read. The platform serves two primary user types:

### üî¨ **Researchers/Administrators**
- Create and manage assessment tasks
- View participant data and analytics
- Configure studies and assignments

### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Participants** (mainly children and families)
- Take assessments and complete tasks
- View their progress and achievements
- Complete surveys about their experience

## Key Terminology

- **Task/Assessment**: Interactive activities that children complete (like games or exercises)
- **Survey**: Questionnaires completed by participants, parents, or teachers
- **Assignment**: A collection of tasks given to a participant
- **Participant**: A person (usually a child) taking part in the research study
- **Administrator**: A researcher or teacher managing the platform

## Tone and Style Guidelines

### For Child-Facing Content:
- **Friendly and encouraging**: Use positive, supportive language
- **Simple and clear**: Avoid complex sentences or academic jargon
- **Age-appropriate**: Remember the primary users are children (5-12 years old)
- **Motivational**: Emphasize fun, games, and achievements

### For Adult-Facing Content:
- **Professional but accessible**: Clear, informative, and respectful
- **Precise**: Use specific, unambiguous language for technical functions
- **Supportive**: Remember parents and teachers may not be tech-savvy

## Cultural Considerations

### Regional Variations
- **es-CO (Colombian Spanish)**: May use different educational terms than standard Spanish
- **en-US vs en-GB**: Different spelling conventions and some terminology differences

### Educational Context
- School-related terms may vary significantly between countries
- Grade levels and educational systems differ across regions
- Consider local cultural norms around technology use with children

## Common UI Patterns

### Buttons and Actions
- Primary actions should be clear and actionable (e.g., "Start Game", "Continue")
- Destructive actions should be clearly marked (e.g., "Sign Out", "Cancel")

### Status Messages
- Loading states should be reassuring
- Error messages should be helpful, not technical
- Success messages should be celebratory for children

### Navigation
- Keep navigation terms consistent throughout the application
- Use familiar web conventions when possible

## Technical Notes

### Variables and Placeholders
- `{timeLeft}` - Countdown timer values
- `{action}` - Clickable links or buttons
- Variables should be preserved exactly as written

### Character Limits
- Button text: Keep concise (usually under 20 characters)
- Form labels: Clear but brief (under 30 characters)
- Error messages: Informative but not overwhelming (under 100 characters)
- Descriptions: Can be longer but should remain scannable

## Questions for Translators

If you encounter unclear context, please ask:
1. Is this content shown to children, parents, teachers, or administrators?
2. Is this a button, label, heading, or body text?
3. Are there any cultural or educational system considerations?
4. Should the tone be formal or informal for this audience?
